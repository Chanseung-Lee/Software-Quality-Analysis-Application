# Introduction

Electro Scientific Industries has several product lines: Flex, Geode, MLCC, and Fusion just to name a few. This projectâ€™s main objective is to create an application that can be used to measure the quality and release readiness of Software across all ESI product groups. The app accomplishes this by implementing two categories of SW metrics: 

**ISO-9001 Metrics** which aims to maintain and improve the quality of products each quarter

**Release Readiness Metrics** which was created by the quality assurance team to measure various aspects of the software process with the main concern of determining whether or not the software builds are ready for release to the customers
